# MOE Teacher Workspace

A design prototype for the **MOE (Ministry of Education) Teacher Workspace** — a centralised hub for school management, student insights, and daily teacher tools. The application includes modules for announcements, forms, reports, student management, groups, student analytics, and an AI insight assistant.

> **Note:** This project uses mock data and is intended as a design/UX prototype — there is no live backend.

## Prerequisites

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** (runtime & package manager) — the project uses `bunfig.toml` to run all scripts with Bun's native runtime.
- **Node.js ≥ 18** (required by some tooling)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/String-sg/design-teacher-workspace.git
   cd design-teacher-workspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

   > The `.npmrc` configures a scoped registry for `@flow/*` packages. No additional auth tokens are needed for public access.

3. **Copy the environment file** (optional — no environment variables are required; feature flags are stored in `localStorage`)

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at **http://127.0.0.1:3000**.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Start the Vite dev server on port 3000 |
| `bun run build` | Create a production build |
| `bun run preview` | Preview the production build locally |
| `bun run test` | Run tests with Vitest |
| `bun run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `bun run format` | Run Prettier |
| `bun run check` | Auto-fix formatting and lint issues (`prettier --write . && eslint --fix`) |

## Dependencies

### Runtime

- **@tanstack/react-start** — Full-stack React framework with SSR
- **@tanstack/react-router** — File-based routing
- **@base-ui/react** — Headless UI primitives from MUI
- **@flow/core & @flow/design-tokens** — MOE Flow Design System
- **@tiptap** extensions — Rich text editor suite
- **recharts** — Charting library
- **tailwindcss** — Utility-first CSS framework
- **lucide-react** — Icon library
- **date-fns** — Date utility library
- **sonner** — Toast notifications
- **class-variance-authority / clsx / tailwind-merge** — ClassName utilities

### Development

- **vite** — Build tool and dev server
- **vitest** — Test runner
- **@testing-library/react & @testing-library/dom** — Component testing utilities
- **jsdom** — DOM environment for tests
- **typescript** — Type checking
- **prettier** — Code formatting
- **shadcn** — CLI to scaffold new UI components

## Tests

The project is configured with **Vitest** and **Testing Library** for component and unit testing. Run the test suite with:

```bash
bun run test
```

There are currently no test files in the repository. When adding tests, place them alongside the source files using the `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` naming convention. Vitest is configured in `vite.config.ts`.

## Adding Shadcn UI Components

New Shadcn components can be scaffolded with:

```bash
bunx shadcn@latest add <component-name>
```

Components are generated into `src/components/ui/` and use Base UI primitives (not Radix). See `components.json` for configuration details.

## Path Aliases

The project uses `@/*` to map to `src/*`:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
```
